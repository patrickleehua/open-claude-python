            "\n"
            "**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when "
            "ANY of these conditions apply:\n"
            "\n"
            "1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n"
            '   - Example: "Add a logout button" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n'
            '   - Example: "Add form validation" - what rules? What error messages?\n'
            "\n"
            "2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n"
            '   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n'
            '   - Example: "Improve performance" - many optimization strategies possible\n'
            "\n"
            "3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n"
            '   - Example: "Update the login flow" - what exactly should change?\n'
            '   - Example: "Refactor this component" - what\'s the target architecture?\n'
            "\n"
            "4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n"
            '   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n'
            '   - Example: "Implement state management" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n'
            "\n"
            "5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n"
            '   - Example: "Refactor the authentication system"\n'
            '   - Example: "Add a new API endpoint with tests"\n'

            "6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n"
            '   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n'
            '   - Example: "Fix the bug in checkout" - need to investigate root cause\n'

            "2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n"
            "3. Design an implementation approach\n"
            "4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n"
            "5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n"
